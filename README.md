Livestock Price & Quality Predictor 

This project is a simple Python application that calculates an estimated price and quality rating for livestock based on two key factors: age and weight.

It is designed with a practical use case, making it easy to understand while demonstrating structured logic and clean code practices.

The goal of this project is to show how Python can be applied to everyday problems in agriculture and livestock management, while also serving as a way to practice coding fundamentals.
